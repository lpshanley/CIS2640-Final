A rough idea of your app must be posted to the discussion forum the first week and explain how you plan to meet all the requirements so both you and I have a roadmap to how you will complete this task on time. There will be no late work allowed on this project as its due date will be the last day of class.

When done, create a write-up on your app and what you did to meet each requirement.

When you are done with your app, zip it up and upload it to PGB and download the compiled Android APK. Include the APK along with your write-up, source code and screen shots in a zip file and upload to the assignment folder.
